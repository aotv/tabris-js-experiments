  [`02-1472`,`6`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`No, Justice O'Connor. They're -- they're not overlapping. The claims in the Federal Circuit case involved three contracts covering fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996.

  [`02-1472`,`8`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Yes, they are, Your Honor. The Federal Circuit applied standard, bedrock Government contracting law, primarily the rule that when a contract payment is conditioned on there being an appropriation, the payment right vests in full once the appropriation is enacted by Congress. And secondly, the court ruled that the Indian Self-Determination Act does not bar the payment of the contracts in this case under the circumstances presented. And to the contrary.

  [`02-1472`,`10`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`No, Justice O'Connor. There -- there is no difference in that respect, and there is an overlap in -- in this sense. The Shoshone-Paiute contract that arose through the Tenth Circuit case did involve fiscal year 1996, the same fiscal year as the Cherokee contract that covered fiscal year 1996. So in that sense, both cases involved the -- the same relevant issues. The -- the key, we think, to the resolution of the act is found in the act on page 12a of the appendix to our opening blue brief. The act was amended in this section twice, in 1988 and in 1994, for three reasons: to secure contract funding, to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, and to eliminate secretarial funding discretion over contract funding issues. In section 12a, 450j-1(a), the bottom half of the page, it is stated in subparagraph (1) that the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then directly pertinent to this case is subparagraph (2), which directs -- which addresses contract support costs. There shall be added to the amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs which shall consist of certain items.

  [`02-1472`,`26`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`It -- it is a unique contractual situation, Justice Scalia, but one that Congress fully anticipated. And -- and I would explain it this way. First of all, there is the Contract Disputes Act which Congress said applies to these contracts. The contracts were so unique that prior to 1988, the Interior Board of Contract Appeals, in a decision called the Busby case, had ruled that these contracts could not be enforced under the Contract Disputes Act precisely for the reason Justice Scalia articulated. Congress changed that. In 1988, Congress amended section 110 of the act, reproduced at the bottom of page 26a, and gave the Court of Claims, then the Court of Claims, and the district courts concurrent jurisdiction over money damages claims under the Contract Disputes Act. And the legislative history explains that Congress did this precisely to overcome the Busby decision and to make these contracts enforceable for the stated contract price.`],
  [`02-1472`,`27`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE KENNEDY`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`But further to Justice Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves contain clauses that say this is not a procurement contract?`],
  [`02-1472`,`28`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`The -- the procurement contract -- that is correct. Not the contracts themselves, Your Honor. The -- the act says that --`],
  [`02-1472`,`29`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE KENNEDY`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`Oh, the act says that they're not procurement contracts.`],
  [`02-1472`,`30`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`-- the contracts are not procurement contracts, Justice Kennedy. That's correct. These contracts began as procurement contracts. They had been procurement contracts, and even still, they were not enforced under the Court of -- the Interior Board of Contract Appeals decision in the Busby decision. Congress relieved the contractors of the procurement system because they felt that the agency had built up an enormous contract monitoring bureaucracy which it wanted to eliminate. And for that reason, it eliminated the procurement rules in the hopes that the contract monitoring bureaucracy would be eliminated along with it.`],

  [`02-1472`,`34`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Justice Ginsburg, I -- I would put my answer in this context. There are many sources from which the Government could have reprogrammed to pay these contracts.

We -- we take $400 million off the top or $300 million off the top because that was specified by Congress for certain purposes. But the balance is a lump sum. The Secretary crafts a budget. The budget is not adopted by Congress, just a dollar amount is adopted by Congress.

  [`02-1472`,`55`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`Yes, but the -- the tribes have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is going to be there at the end of the day?`],
  [`02-1472`,`56`,`TRUE`,`MR.

It's been the law for 120 years that at that point, the right to payment vests and the tribe is entitled to be paid.`],
  [`02-1472`,`57`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`All right. So how was that appropriation money in fact used by the Federal Government, do you say?`],

  [`02-1472`,`64`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Yes, thank you, Justice Souter, for taking me back to your question. What we mean is that the Secretary submits a budget, but the budget is not binding on the Secretary. It's not binding as a matter of law because Congress didn't adopt it.

  [`02-1472`,`74`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Well, the times have changed. Since 1998, fiscal year 1998, Congress has imposed caps on the contracts and court costs that the agency has. So there's no question the agency cannot pay more than Congress gives it.

If I walked into the office of the headquarters of the Indian Health Service in Rockville, Maryland, I'm not going to see doctors and nurses in white jackets.

And if any money is going to be squeezed, the person who's going to be squeezed or the -- is the -- is the agency itself. Its bureaucracy is going to have less money.

  [`02-1472`,`106`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`I say that for two reasons. First of all, the -- the Congress, in our opinion, clearly privileged the tribal contracts over the Secretary's Federal functions. But more practically, let's look at the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. They took over a hospital that had a $5 million budget in round numbers, and the contract support costs requirement was $2 million. So the contract was in round numbers $7 million. So they get the hospital, $5 million to run it. They don't get the $2 million. Now, they have $3 million to run the hospital. It's not that they didn't get their bureaucracy. They didn't get the full hospital operational budget because they had to pay the fixed costs of carrying insurance, undertaking the audits required by Federal law. There were actual reductions in services so severe, in fact, that the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe nearly lost accreditation.`],

  [`02-1472`,`109`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`-- which maybe others understand, but I'm confused. Imagine that this has nothing to do with Indians.

In our imaginary department of Government, the appropriation is $1 billion. Nothing is earmarked for anything. They enter into contracts that amount to $999 million. Now, they pay out $990 million, and their -- what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy. So there's no valid contract here. The appropriation wasn't made. Now, my understanding of ordinary Government contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in principle available for the contracts. You look to something called the purpose-time-amount test. So was it during the same time? Yes. Is it in an appropriate amount? Yes. But is it available for this purpose? Ah, I'm not sure. All right. Now, I want -- if I have the -- the theory of it right, I want you to tell me what the money was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million in my example that you believe in principle was available to pay these -- for this Indian expenditure.

  [`02-1472`,`120`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`One of the purposes was paying contracts, and that's because in this act, the appropriation says here's $1.4 billion or $1.8 billion to carry out the Indian Self-Determination Act. So that satisfies the purpose test.`],

  [`02-1472`,`133`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE KENNEDY`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`Well, the Government says it's unique because the tribes are providing governmental services. It doesn't really cite us a case where, say, a city or a subdivision has sued under a contract.`],

  [`02-1472`,`173`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, first and foremost, the text of the statute.

  [`02-1472`,`175`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`It's not, Justice O'Connor, with respect.

  [`02-1472`,`176`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`That phrase is the same, subject to the availability of appropriations.`],
  [`02-1472`,`177`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`That particular phrase resembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his hypothetical.`],
  [`02-1472`,`178`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Exactly.`],
  [`02-1472`,`179`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`But the term available -- and I think this is critical.

  [`02-1472`,`180`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SOUTER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`But -- but the other -- the other side says you don't have to get to that because you could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing funds available for other tribes. It's simply that it would have squeezed you in your budget, your -- your headquarters operating budget for IHS.

  [`02-1472`,`181`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`I -- I think that argument is incorrect. First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation of the terms of the reduction clause.

And if you'll look at page 12a -- and I'm quoting from 450j-1(a)(1) -- what provision says is the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts include the amount that the Secretary, quote, would have otherwise provided. And then later on down in the paragraph --`],

  [`02-1472`,`185`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Shall not -- shall be not less than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then further down in the paragraph in the last -- in the last clause, including support of administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. And what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are certain functions that are not otherwise contractable, namely those core, inherent Federal functions that the agency itself is required to provide. And so what 450j-1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to the contracting tribes because the agency requires those funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a Federal agency.`],
  [`02-1472`,`186`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE KENNEDY`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`But -- but I thought the submission of the petitioners' counsel was that some of these funds were used to monitor the contracts which are functions the tribes could have performed. So is there a factual disagreement here?`],
  [`02-1472`,`187`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. I think it's more of a characterization disagreement. There -- it's true that in a descriptive sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for core agency functions are outside the funds to be -- to be turned over.`],
  [`02-1472`,`188`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`It doesn't say that. It doesn't say that. What it says is otherwise contractable. And they could certainly -- for a lay person like me in this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of Interior. Well, if it said that, then that's not otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.`],

  [`02-1472`,`190`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`So otherwise contractable sounds like a -- a statutory question.`],
  [`02-1472`,`191`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`But it -- it's not talking about money that's otherwise contractable.

  [`02-1472`,`194`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, it's talking about both because the -- the first part of subparagraph (1) is the amount of funds. It's relating to the amount of funds that are required to be transferred, and what it stands for is that funds for supportive administrative functions that are not otherwise contractable, i.e., those core agency functions that the agency is required to perform itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to contracting tribes. And that just reflects the common sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist to perform some core functions.`],
  [`02-1472`,`195`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`But how do you -- how do you square that with the -- on page 14a -- reductions and, as Mr. Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract managing -- monitoring or administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls under the heading Federal functions.`],
  [`02-1472`,`196`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Justice Ginsburg, the way we square that under the statute is that the leading -- the initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of funds required by subsection (a) of this section.

And so what (b) deals with is the funds that are left over after the funds for inherent Federal functions are taken off the top.`],
  [`02-1472`,`197`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`So are these noninherent Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal functions? So there's inherent Federal functions and noninherent?`],
  [`02-1472`,`198`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Oh, absolutely there are. The Federal functions is the broader set of -- it could essentially encompass everything the Federal Government does. Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set of functions that the agency itself is required to perform.

  [`02-1472`,`204`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`And we describe the -- the relevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me for just one second, on page 31. When Congress enacted the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the BIA -- and this is at the beginning of the first partial paragraph that begins with of particular significance. There's a provision there, 25 U.S.C. 458cc(k). And the provision reads that nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to expand or alter existing statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to enter into any agreement with respect to functions that are inherently Federal.

  [`02-1472`,`225`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Can I ask you sort of a basic question that I'm having trouble following? As I understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and so forth that can't be reduced. Now, is there anything in the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?`],
  [`02-1472`,`226`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, there is, Justice Stevens, in the following sense. It's not at all the case that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing the allocation scheme in any fiscal year.`],
  [`02-1472`,`227`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`But his budget that he actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated by the statute, as I understand.`],

  [`02-1472`,`232`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`-- but at least in significant part. And let me -- but I think this is significant, and if I can just walk the Court through the process by which the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately is allocated. The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the next year's allocation will be built. And that's reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a of the appendix to the blue brief. There's a provision, 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is the reduction in appropriations. But we're not dealing with that in the relevant fiscal years. There was always an increase. And so the Secretary, pursuant to the statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at the level that it was at the previous fiscal year. Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds two -- two considerations on top. The first is mandatory across-the-board increases for things such as salary COLA's and inflationary adjustments. And that's a standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in the terms of the statute. And that -- I'd point the Court to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where we cite a provision, 25 U.S.C. 1680a.`],

  [`02-1472`,`245`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`See, the thing that troubles me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the contractual problem -- provision illusory because they can always allocate funds to all these other projects and say, well, we've already used up the money.`],
  [`02-1472`,`246`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`No, I don't think that they have discretion to do that. And that's what I'm trying to explain. At least with respect to the existing baseline and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated by the statute that the -- that the Secretary conduct his budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done. With respect to the mandatory across-the-board increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C. 1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for, quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, other expenses relating to the provision of health services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such funds are provided to programs and services operated directly. In other words, with respect to mandatory across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-contracting tribes. And that leaves the additional set of an increase from one year to the next year that deals with specific targeted items, and principally that would include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come on board during the course of a particular fiscal year. And with respect to those specific targeted items, the critical point is that the contracting tribes often benefit from the addition of those and from the enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks. For example, in this particular case, the -- one of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic in Oklahoma. That was a new facility that came on board in the early 1990s and for which the -- for which the Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a self-determination agreement. Now, the staffing for that facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's budget submissions and in -- in Congress' appropriation committee reports. And it, of course, is in the Cherokee Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are honored.`],
  [`02-1472`,`247`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Are you telling me that the committee reports are -- are binding law?`],
  [`02-1472`,`248`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`They're not binding law, Justice Stevens. We fully recognize that. But at the same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the committee reports.`],
  [`02-1472`,`249`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SOUTER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`No. But you got a conflict apparently between the committee reports and what seems to be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental agreements. And in -- in that conflict, I don't see why contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.`],
  [`02-1472`,`250`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`It's not just the committee reports, Justice Souter. It's the reduction clause. The reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the proper interpretation of the contract.`],
  [`02-1472`,`251`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SOUTER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`And -- and their -- their argument is that you can pay the contract amount without robbing other tribes of the amounts that the -- that the nonreduction clause refers to. They are saying -- I think they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy, get squeezed. Yes. And if so, the contract comes first and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to Congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're getting squeezed out of existence. I think that's what they're saying.`],
  [`02-1472`,`252`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`That is what they're saying, Justice Souter, but with respect to, I think it's incorrect. The Government bureaucracy consists of two separate types of bureaucracy. There's that core bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions. And one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to perform those functions.`],
  [`02-1472`,`253`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`No, he's not. But if -- if -- where I'm really coming from, to be honest -- and I'd like -- you might as well reply to what I'm actually -- is why I'm asking these slightly hostile questions. (Laughter.)`],
  [`02-1472`,`254`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`I -- I read here -- look, the question really is was this money like the bureaucracy money. Is it legally speaking an appropriation available, not practically speaking but legally? And here it seems to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes. And so I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals. So if they're saying that money from a contract point -- a point of normal contract law is legally available, I promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right. So I might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.`],
  [`02-1472`,`255`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Because, Justice Breyer, I think the core of it is that even if you think that they're right, that these funds are legally available, that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that he not be required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.`],
  [`02-1472`,`256`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, there is -- is -- the kind -- the money that's available to one tribe can't be taken for the other. But I thought the Board of Contract Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still enough money left over. Am I wrong about that? I thought you should take money from one tribe to give it to another. What did they think?`],

They just thought that legal availability would be sufficient. Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that funds for inherent Federal functions are available. And we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said. I don't think those funds ever came into the group of funds that were subject to be transferred to begin with.

  [`02-1472`,`266`,`TRUE`,`MR.

With respect to the administrative support --`],
  [`02-1472`,`267`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`On -- on that point -- on that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed considerable displeasure with the Government because he said three times I said, tell me what existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced if these contract support costs are paid in full. And he said, I asked them again and again and again, and they were unresponsive. So since the Government declined to tell the court what programs -- existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as I think the Federal Circuit did, that the proof is unavailable and no existing program with other tribes would have been diminished?`],
  [`02-1472`,`268`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`I don't -- I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg. I mean, one straightforward reason why you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court, it's also the Tenth Circuit case. And there's -- there are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that specifically assert that diverting funding for -- to pay for the contract support costs of these tribes would have required reducing funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe.`],
  [`02-1472`,`269`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Now, what does that mean?`],

  [`02-1472`,`271`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`I mean, one thing is existing contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then another thing is, well, we think that there's a new program that could be good for some tribe. So we're going to put that new program in and say that that steps in front of these contract support costs. Are we talking just about existing programs that -- that the Government has made a commitment to, or are we saying the Government is at liberty to benefit tribes?

  [`02-1472`,`272`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`We're talking about both existing programs and new programs, and with respect to new programs, there's -- it's every bit as likely that those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as noncontracting tribes.

  [`02-1472`,`273`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`It's strange to talk of reducing -- is -- is not required to reduce funding for a new program. I mean, for a new program, there isn't any funding. How can you reduce the funding for a new program?`],
  [`02-1472`,`274`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Because --`],
  [`02-1472`,`275`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`That provision makes sense with regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense with regard to proposed programs.`],
  [`02-1472`,`276`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, I don't think that reduce necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the baseline. We think that what it takes as the baseline is the current year's appropriation allocation which takes into account increases. And one way to see that is 25 U.S.C. 1680a, which is the provision that I cited earlier that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across-the-board increases on a proportionate basis as between contracted programs and noncontracted programs. And what that provision means is that the reduction takes into account those mandatory across-the-board increases from year to year. So in some sense, I think reduce does mean this year's allocation of appropriations as opposed to last year's spending amount.`],
  [`02-1472`,`277`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SOUTER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you alluded a moment ago in -- in answering Justice Ginsburg, I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case that -- that specifically said we would have to reduce funds available for other programs.

Did it say -- did the declarations say we will have to reduce the X program for the Navajo Tribe and the Y program for the Apache Tribe and so on, or was it -- did the declarations simply say, as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations for other tribes?`],
  [`02-1472`,`278`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, they -- they make the point as a general matter, and they also give an example.

  [`02-1472`,`281`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`It seems to me you can interpret those comments as saying we don't -- they did not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.`],
  [`02-1472`,`282`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`You're -- you're speaking with particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?`],
  [`02-1472`,`283`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Yes. It seems to me that you can interpret what you're saying as the -- as the -- the Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough room for all the programs it wants to support in the current year and continuing to honor the obligations under the existing contracts.`],
  [`02-1472`,`284`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs. If you look at the figures, the shortfall in contract support costs, for example, in 1997 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's -- that is more than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 to FY 1997. It's more than the amount that was reserved by the Government for inherent Federal functions. And so even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.`],
  [`02-1472`,`285`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Is there some way to avoid these problems now? Has anything changed?`],
  [`02-1472`,`286`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Justice O'Connor, Congress changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning with 1998. It had done so since 1994 for the BIA and it did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS.`],
  [`02-1472`,`287`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Why was there that difference between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?`],
  [`02-1472`,`288`,`TRUE`,`MR. SRINIVASAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall. My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond. And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two. But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act. And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list -- at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA. And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997. So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA. I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available. And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts. And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to -- to divert the entire amount of administrative support for -- for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years. Thank you.`],

  [`02-1472`,`291`,`FALSE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Justice Stevens, thank you. First, I'd like to address the availability of appropriations clause briefly. That is a term of art with a well-established meaning. This Court in Morissette said that if -- unless there's a contrary direction from Congress that the term of art should not be given its well-established meaning, it controls. And that is the meaning, purpose, time, and amount, that the appropriation is available for the purpose during the time and in the amounts necessary to fully --`],
  [`02-1472`,`292`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`I think they disagree with you about the purpose in respect to the core Government function.`],
  [`02-1472`,`293`,`TRUE`,`MR. MILLER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Secondly, with regard to the core governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a settlement with the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration had to reprogram. From where? We don't know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and wanted to get approval from the Congress for that reprogramming action. Congress then stepped in but after the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the Court then held when the payment was due, money was legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes from. There is no protection for inherent Federal functions. It may have come from some other hospital budget. It may have come from some other activity of the Veterans Administration. No doubt everything the VA does is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal obligation to pay the contract. There is no rule that has an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains. Secondly, when funds are not available, we know what happens. This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis' decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens when funds are not available. There was a line item appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. We understand that the contractor was on notice. Everything is square. Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where the money could have come from, not that the Government had to do it. Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to reprogram, that's their right. But then there's a remedy. Where could the money have come from? In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor. No other contractor was apparently shorted. There was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year. There was 55 -- $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million. There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions. They couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor? Not that they had to. They could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices. That was their decision. But the contractor didn't take the risk that the Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you. No contractor takes that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either. There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory in this case. The Secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the Secretary. Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my decision and I've made my judgment. I don't have enough money to pay you. There's no limit here on contract support costs. It could be the secretarial amount. They could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability. And we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last. Now, that's not what the -- that's not what the statute permits. That sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity. With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision, Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the Tenth Circuit. There was a declaration in the Tenth Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes. Now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment. So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal Circuit decision affirmed. Unless the Court has more questions.`],

  [`02-1672`,`303`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`That is true, Justice Kennedy.`],
  [`02-1672`,`304`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE KENNEDY`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`Even -- even assuming the -- the validity of your premise, you still have another step.`],
  [`02-1672`,`305`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`I understand that other step, and I think that was largely resolved in Cannon v. the City of Chicago, a decision which this Court upheld a right of action to enforce title IX, even though there was also administrative remedies available and which was validated by Congress, as this Court -- every member of this Court recognized in -- in Sandoval.`],
  [`02-1672`,`306`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`I thought -- I thought that Cannon -- we've -- we've allowed Cannon to stay on the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of creation of -- of implied remedies that Cannon exemplifies.`],
  [`02-1672`,`307`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`In this case, there is no doubt that the two established principles together that are settled support this cause of action. The first is that there is a cause of action to enforce title IX. That's Cannon through Congress, through Sandoval, through -- your opinion in Sandoval acknowledges that Cannon is solid law and, the second point, that the statute itself is violated. Title IX is violated by retaliatory action against Coach Jackson. He's -- and -- and this is an important part of title IX because, particularly here, people like Coach Jackson need to come forward because students are often minors. They're not in the best position to know the budgets. It is people like Coach Jackson who make it work, and indeed, I think what is recognized about the -- about the cause of action for retaliation is that it is very important to enable people to bring their institutions into compliance without resorting to litigation.`],
  [`02-1672`,`308`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`It's very -- it's very useful, I'm sure, but it -- it could be very disruptive also, I am sure. If I were -- if I were a coach, one of the first things -- especially a coach of a women's team in high school, one of the first things I would do would be to complain about not -- not getting enough facilities. This would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether -- whether I'm a lousy coach or not. You -- you would have to think twice before you fire me because I would have a retaliation claim.`],
  [`02-1672`,`309`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Justice Scalia, the burden, of course, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation. And you should take great comfort from the fact, the Court can take great comfort from the fact that retaliation has been established as a violation of all of the major civil rights statutes, going back to 30 years to title VI --`],
  [`02-1672`,`310`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`Some of them specifically provide for retaliation, don't they?`],
  [`02-1672`,`311`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`That is correct.`],
  [`02-1672`,`312`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`Why do they do that if, as you assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?`],
  [`02-1672`,`313`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Well, Congress has taken a different approach. In some cases, there would be a textual problem. Title VII, for example, speaks of discrimination based on such individual's race or national origin. Title -- and -- and therefore, it might need a specific retaliation provision. Title IX speaks upon -- about discrimination on the basis of sex. And here I think to -- to allay your concern about the coach, we have had -- title IX's retaliation provision has been the established law. It was the law at the time Congress -- it was understood, at the time Congress enacted title IX, that the identical wording of title VI had been construed by the administrative agency to include a cause of action for retaliation. Congress enacted title IX against the background of the Sullivan decision, which had recognized that discrimination can include retaliation. So that it comes as no surprise that every court of appeals that has addressed this issue has found that there's retaliation under title IX. In over 30 years, there -- at most we can find 140 reported cases in the Federal system where there is a claim for retaliation under title IX, and under title IX and all of the other discrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly satisfactory to work out the causation requirements and -- in -- in dealing with retaliation cases. Now, here, what the respondent did is they discharged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for girls. When it singled Coach Jackson out for adverse treatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so, because he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was discriminating on the basis of sex.`],
  [`02-1672`,`314`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`Do you think that it -- it is a reasonable description of what happened -- he was fired for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough facilities -- that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program?`],
  [`02-1672`,`315`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Absolutely.`],
  [`02-1672`,`316`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`Do you think that -- that remotely describes what happened to this coach?`],
  [`02-1672`,`317`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Absolutely. First of all, the -- the court of appeals correctly says -- in the petition appendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for the purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated against Jackson for complaining about perceived title IX violations. But for the discrimination on the basis of sex, he would not have complained, and he not -- had he not made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't have lost his position. He is denied the benefit of coaching in the program. He's denied the ability to participate in this federally funded program as a coach, and he is discriminated against by being singled out for retaliation. And this is not a case in which -- that has concern -- I mean, Justice Kennedy raised the question about this being a funding case, and I understand the special sensitivity that the Court has about rules that are based upon spending requirements where you want to be sure that States understand what they're agreeing to when they accept the Federal funds. This is not a case in which it could not have been anticipated when those funds were accepted. At that time, at the time these funds were accepted, which would have been about 1999 or 2000, title IX's ban on sex discrimination was itself, of course, universally known. Retaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that. We had had 30 years where both the Department of Education and --`],
  [`02-1672`,`318`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE KENNEDY`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`But -- but that's again the question of the substantive scope of the provision, and that's different from whether there was a congressional intent to create a private cause of action for this sort of violation. And was it -- Virginia Bankshares and so forth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior cause of actions anymore. You have to show that there's a congressional intent in the Spending Clause to create a private cause of action for damages.`],

  [`02-1672`,`322`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE KENNEDY`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`-- from this -- from the question of substantive liability.`],
  [`02-1672`,`323`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`I understand that. Here, first of all, when Congress acted, unlike the earlier time when it passed title VI, when Congress passed title IX, it was a background in the law from Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park that -- that retaliation was considered a part of discrimination. The title VI regulations were themselves well known based on identical language, virtually verbatim language. It provided for retaliation. And moreover, this Court as recently as the Davis case, Franklin and Davis, and in the North Haven case has found that employment discrimination, sexual harassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment all come within title IX and have, therefore, agreed that Cannon v. the City of -- v. the University of Chicago creates that cause of action. Now, this case is actually a lot easier than Davis, even taking into account the concerns that -- that you and other Justices expressed there, because this is not a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for the acts of third parties like students over whom you may have limited control. This is deliberately undertaken actions by the responsible officials acting intentionally. It's not a novel concept the way one could argue that peer-on-peer sexual harassment was as a part of discrimination. But it's been accepted for more than 30 years by the responsible Federal agency.`],
  [`02-1672`,`324`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`Yes, but it's separate enough from discrimination that in other statutes, although Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination, it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of action for retaliation. It's sufficiently separate, and if it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me that you could clearly say that -- that when the State signed on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they should have known that this door to litigation was being opened to them. Yes, litigation for -- for discrimination against -- against female athletes, but not -- not discrimination suits alleging retaliation. That's a whole, new area.`],

And it's not just whistle blowers, Justice Kennedy. It's people that want to make their institutions comply and when those efforts at compliance result in penalties against them.

And -- and I -- I understand the -- going to the necessity, but I do think I'm very comfortable with the statute because it is a form of discrimination on the basis of sex. It is part and parcel.

And in -- and section 1982 was interpreted to mean discrimination on the basis of race in depriving people of interests of property violates that statute and affords a private right of action to the victim of retaliation. And so too here. And a person who is victimized by retaliation because that person has been subjected before -- because he complained about sex discrimination is a victim of discrimination within the meaning of this statute.`],
  [`02-1672`,`405`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`And that's where you hang. You -- you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX, paid close attention and said -- instead of saying no person in the United States shall on the basis of that person's sex be excluded from participation, you think somebody had -- had suggested that language, and they said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow. We have to take out that person's. I -- I don't -- it doesn't strike me as a -- as an obvious import of not including the word that person's sex. It's a very natural way to write it: no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex.`],
  [`02-1672`,`406`,`TRUE`,`MR. GORNSTEIN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`But this is -- it opens it up to this interpretation, and then you have to look at all the relevant considerations. Inserting the words, such individual's, would foreclose that kind of retaliation claim, and it's not here. And so it's -- then you have to look at all the other relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the fact that this is of vital importance to promoting the purposes of the act, including the fact that the agencies responsible for enforcing this provision have both interpreted -- the key agencies have interpreted it to encompass protection against retaliation, and including the fact that there's absolutely no legitimate interest that a -- a recipient has in retaliating against somebody simply because he's filed a title IX sex discrimination complaint.`],
  [`02-1672`,`407`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`Mr. Gornstein, what implication would there be, if we took the view of the circuit here, for Federal employment? Title VII does have a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with respect to Federal employees, if I understand.`],
  [`02-1672`,`408`,`TRUE`,`MR. GORNSTEIN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`That's correct. In -- it -- we -- we have taken the position that there is, based on a textual argument within the Federal sector provision, a basis for finding a retaliation prohibition over and above the use of discrimination. We have not taken that position with respect to the -- to some other statutes. So we do think this is a statute-by-statute analysis and that you just can't adopt an automatic principle that because there's an anti-discrimination provision, it automatically always picks up retaliation protection. You have to look at it on a statute-by-statute basis. And here, though, all the relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the need for this kind of protection to further the purposes of the statute, including the agencies' interpretation of this statute which, by the way, does provide fair notice that this was prohibited, included in -- I think I wanted to get back to Justice Kennedy's question about the Spending Clause. What the Spending Clause does not require is that it specifically refer to retaliation any more than it required that it specifically refer to peer-on-peer harassment. What it does require, though, is fair notice, and that fair notice is supplied by the Sullivan decision, this Court's cases saying that Sullivan is an important backdrop principle against which title IX was enacted, and finally the regulations themselves, which specifically forbid retaliation.`],
  [`02-1672`,`409`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`Are punitive damages available under title IX?`],
  [`02-1672`,`410`,`TRUE`,`MR. GORNSTEIN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`I'm sorry. Punitive damages would not be available against a municipality or against a -- but it could be available against some other private recipients.`],
  [`02-1672`,`411`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Thomas.`],
  [`02-1672`,`413`,`FALSE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Justice O'Connor, I would like to respond to the question that you raised immediately. I can't think of any school board lawyer who is called by his superintendent and told that I had a letter from OCR and they want to know why you aren't doing this and that who would not be in that superintendent's office that moment because when OCR comes in, they canvas everything. I mean, and as a part of negotiating and their investigative teams, they're lay people. They're not lawyers. They come in demanding, and what they prepare for compliance, I can't even begin to articulate how overreaching it is. And so I say I wanted you to --`],
  [`02-1672`,`414`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`How often has OCR come to the school district in question under title IX? There are many statutes that --`],
  [`02-1672`,`415`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`And I would want to suggest --`],
  [`02-1672`,`416`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`-- OCR administers.`],
  [`02-1672`,`417`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`In 1996, we had a conclusion of an OCR title IX investigation because it dealt with boys' football as it related to related sports offered for girls. So we -- we know about OCR, and they're in Atlanta. They are about 167 miles away and when -- and when they come, they come, Your Honors. If I may, I'd like to get right now to what I had raised as the issue here, and that's whether or not an implied private right of action under title IX for retaliation for petitioner who himself says that he's not a victim of discrimination, but merely an advocate. He's an advocate of gender equity, and we say no.`],
  [`02-1672`,`418`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`How does he differ -- how does he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to African Americans? He wanted to lease his property, and as a result, he was thrown out of the club. And this Court said he could maintain that suit.`],
  [`02-1672`,`419`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Justice Ginsburg, I offer this one observation. Under 1982, there is not a corollary administrative remedy. So in the Sullivan situation, the only advocate available at that time was the owner of the home. And -- but I would comment that as he continued in his litigation, he continued to advocate. Under title IX, as we have discussed, for the advocate is the phone call, the toll-free call to OCR and express your concerns and your issues about what's happening. And we find significance in that because the ultimate benefit is for the designated class, which would be the basketball team. In a private lawsuit filed by Mr. Jackson, the damage award goes directly to him. If he's successful in getting injunctive relief, it goes only to him. In other words, school board, you can't retaliate or you're enjoined from retaliating against him in the future, but nothing from that Federal court would go to benefit the girls' basketball team.`],
  [`02-1672`,`420`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SOUTER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, what -- what do you make of the -- the point that Mr. Dellinger stressed and others have stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative remedy in the real world? It's -- it's -- there -- there have never -- there has never been an instance in which funds have been withheld.`],
  [`02-1672`,`421`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, again, Justice Souter, no, the funds have not been terminated. But I can only share with you my experiences with dealing with these people.`],
  [`02-1672`,`422`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`May I ask you with respect to that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to pick and choose because they simply don't have the resources to enforce? Now, how often does OCR, in fact, go in and investigate? How many times do they say, well, that's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls' basketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?`],
  [`02-1672`,`423`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that I can say is that on my watch, the number one priority is to keep OCR out. So -- so therefore --`],
  [`02-1672`,`424`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`But that wasn't my question. My question is of the universe of complaints that are made under title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or isn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however much it may want to, come in the way you described?`],
  [`02-1672`,`425`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, Your Honor, that was something that was recognized in Cannon. I -- I think that was cited in several of the footnotes.`],
  [`02-1672`,`426`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`And that was the very reason for recognizing a private right of action because the -- the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement, would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could enforce it.`],
  [`02-1672`,`427`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`But -- but again, stay mindful. Geraldine Cannon, though, she said, I did not get admission to the -- the med school because of my sex, and she is clearly within the proviso of no discrimination on the basis of sex. So --`],
  [`02-1672`,`428`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SOUTER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Yes, but the -- the argument that's being raised is whether we're talking about the person who is listed in the statute as the primary beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and so on -- the -- the argument is unless you allow this teacher or this whistle blower to -- to bring the private action, your statute is a dead letter, that the -- that if -- if -- once you recognize a private action, you've either got to recognize this kind of private action or you can forget the whole thing. That's the argument, and -- and so simply to say, well, they're not within the -- the primary ambit of benefit of the statute is -- is not to the point of the argument.`],
  [`02-1672`,`429`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Justice Souter, let me offer this in two ways. One, it's not realistic. In -- in other words, when -- when you have a scenario about the private cause of action, teachers aren't -- I mean, these parents and -- and the -- and especially in Birmingham, we have an athletic director at the school. We have a director of athletics for the whole school system. And so that -- that's not realistic, I mean, because at the end of the day, the administration is very conscientious about all of its programs.`],
  [`02-1672`,`430`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, that's -- to say trust me is -- is not an answer. Cannon is one thing, a woman in her 30's. A sixth-grader who is told she can't play on a team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly situated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless you have someone who is best positioned to know what is going on, who is the coach.`],
  [`02-1672`,`431`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`But, Justice Ginsburg, we get back to the point who really benefits because -- and especially in this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the monetary damages, that goes to the advocate.`],
  [`02-1672`,`432`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`The -- the point is if you say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone because a complaint has been made, that's a powerful incentive for the school not to retaliate against someone and to do something about the discrimination.`],
  [`02-1672`,`433`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, but again, though, Justice Ginsburg, the other side of that would be when under the spending legislation, the school board had a right to know what the terms and conditions of the financial assistance would be, and I respectfully submit to you that there was nowhere on the landscape that --`],
  [`02-1672`,`434`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Why wasn't it in the regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly -- the -- the agency that says, Congress has told us to implement this statute, here are our regulations and our regulations are you don't retaliate?`],
  [`02-1672`,`435`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`But that's a part of the complaint and investigatory process. Now, Justice Ginsburg --`],
  [`02-1672`,`436`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`RESPONDENT`,`The regulations didn't say anything about a private cause of action, did it?`],
  [`02-1672`,`437`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`No, it did not.`],
  [`02-1672`,`438`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`RESPONDENT`,`And the statute didn't say anything about a private cause of action.`],
  [`02-1672`,`439`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`It's not on the face.`],
  [`02-1672`,`440`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`But the regulation did tell the school not to retaliate in effect. Tell me, does the record disclose what happened to the petitioner, Jackson? What -- what has been the result of all this? Does the record tell us that?`],
  [`02-1672`,`441`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`No, it does not, Justice O'Connor. And -- and again, it's on a motion to dismiss, and obviously, once it was --`],
  [`02-1672`,`442`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Does it tell us that he was removed as coach?`],
  [`02-1672`,`443`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Yes.`],
  [`02-1672`,`444`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Does the record tell us that?`],
  [`02-1672`,`445`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`It -- it does say that he was relieved.`],
  [`02-1672`,`446`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Can I ask you a legal question, nothing to do with, you know, practicalities?`],
  [`02-1672`,`447`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Yes.`],
  [`02-1672`,`448`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`But suppose you go back to the very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's. They pass some civil rights legislation. A lot of legislation was passed in the '60's. Now, under that civil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been kept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically badly, not because of his race. He was white, but he was associating with people who were black. And they both go into the restaurant and they both are refused service. Maybe they're beaten up. I mean, both of them. Now, can the white individual bring a lawsuit under the -- the civil rights statute? I've always thought the answer to that question is, of course, he can. Would you -- do you think it's the contrary answer?`],
  [`02-1672`,`449`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Justice Breyer, in that context --`],
  [`02-1672`,`450`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Yes.`],
  [`02-1672`,`451`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`-- I -- I would say yes.`],
  [`02-1672`,`452`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Yes, of course.`],
  [`02-1672`,`453`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`But again --`],
  [`02-1672`,`454`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`So therefore --`],
  [`02-1672`,`455`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`RESPONDENT`,`Is this a civil rights statute that provides for a private cause of action? I -- I want to know what the hypothetical is.`],
  [`02-1672`,`456`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`I'd -- I'd like to -- I'm thinking of various civil rights statutes which make it unlawful to describe -- to -- to discriminate. And now, I agree with you on that answer. The white person could bring a lawsuit on the basis of someone else's race because he's being discriminated against not because of his own race, but because he's being -- he's associated with people who are being discriminated against. I agree with your answer. And so my question is if that's so and if we have a long history here of the words, on the basis of sex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but retaliation on the basis of someone else's sex -- that's what I've complained of -- why isn't this the same thing And to get out my whole question -- there are two parts -- why isn't this the same thing? And the second part is, because I think it is the same thing -- the second part is once it is included in 1981 -- in -- is it 1681(a)?`],
  [`02-1672`,`457`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Yes.`],
  [`02-1672`,`458`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Once we include this in 1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then supports the other side. It doesn't support you. All right. That's my question.`],
  [`02-1672`,`459`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Justice Breyer, don't we have to consider at some point in time what the congressional intent was?`],
  [`02-1672`,`460`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, yes.`],
  [`02-1672`,`461`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`And again -- and I submit to you --`],
  [`02-1672`,`462`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`So you -- you go ahead. I'm doing it purely as a matter of logic. I'm saying the old civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the basis of your own race. History makes clear that retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit within -- or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's the end of the case. So I would like your response to that logic.`],
  [`02-1672`,`463`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`And I would want to submit to you interveningly you have had the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. So everybody now has access to Congress. The whole spectrum of American society is in Congress. So if Congress is being well represented, when it passes the law in 1972, as it did here, it had a different perspective on it. Going back to 1969, some things were foreclosed to some of the citizens of the United States. So, obviously, the scenario of someone advocating, like in Sullivan, would make sense. But I submit to you respectfully, that's not the case now. Over there in Congress is where this debate needs to be, and on the face of this statute, it's not there. Retaliation is not there. If I may, though, Justice Breyer, let me also add as a practical consideration --`],
  [`02-1672`,`464`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Of course, you say it's not there, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought it was there. Isn't that correct?`],
  [`02-1672`,`465`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`But -- but that's an -- an investigatory -- the administrative enforcement scenario.`],
  [`02-1672`,`466`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`But it's the --`],
  [`02-1672`,`467`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`No, but their reading of the statute was that the word discrimination included a retaliation claim. That's the kind of regulations they drafted on the basis of their understanding of what Congress intended by using the word -- the words in this statute.`],
  [`02-1672`,`468`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`But don't we go -- Justice Stevens, don't we go back to Sandoval? Can you in a regulation do more than what the statute requires?`],
  [`02-1672`,`469`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`You cannot use the regulation that goes beyond the meaning of the statute. That's what that holds. But a regulation interpreting what the statute itself provides is in a different ball park. And that's what I understand these regulations to have done, to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.`],
  [`02-1672`,`470`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`But -- but again, that's retaliation after someone has filed a complaint with the appropriate office.`],
  [`02-1672`,`471`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well -- I mean, Sandoval is very clear. It's a very clear opinion in my view. Very clear. And the key language I thought is, the language statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer the private right. So they're looking at disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the majority -- I was in the dissent -- did not intend to protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally discriminate. I can understand that. But I apply the same -- I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it. The -- the -- I apply the same reasoning here. The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not trying to protect university behavior one whit more than the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university behavior. This is about victims. Retaliation and being fired is about victims. And so given Sandoval, then we have the history, we have the language, and we have that sentence from Sandoval. And all that suggests -- it goes into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right of action, given Cannon, would be inferred. Now, what's -- what's -- that's how -- I'm tracing out the logic of the thing. So I want to see what you say.`],
  [`02-1672`,`472`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, Justice Breyer, on the face of the statute, I just can't get there. I apologize for that, respectfully, but -- but I can't. And Justice O'Connor, as a follow-up, interestingly enough, in a case on all fours in 1995, Holt v. Lewis, the United States District Dourt for the Northern District of Birmingham -- for the Northern District of Alabama made very clear that an implied private right of action was not cognizable under title IX, and that the regulation was not a basis to follow it. And -- and I submit to you on that basis, that in Birmingham, at very least, because the case was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit and this Court denied cert in 1997, so anyone who would go --`],
  [`02-1672`,`473`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`We -- we can't -- you don't base your argument on giving some legal effect to denial of certiorari --`],

  [`02-1672`,`475`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Thank you.`],
  [`02-1672`,`476`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`But -- but to say -- I was trying to emphasize was the notice and the mind set of the board when it accepted these Federal funds. It had no way of anticipating that retaliation --`],
  [`02-1672`,`477`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`It had never anticipated a private right of action, even though it read the Cannon opinion, which was written some 20 years ago? Maybe more than that. I don't remember.`],
  [`02-1672`,`478`,`TRUE`,`MR. THOMAS`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Justice Cannon, your opinion there is going to be around for a long time. The scholars are going to have to debate it for years.`],
  [`02-1672`,`479`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`RESPONDENT`,`There were some later cases that cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply Cannon anymore.`],

  [`02-1672`,`481`,`TRUE`,`MR.

  [`02-1672`,`486`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, it seems to me that if you're talking about the sixth grade soccer team, realistically the only one who is going to know anything -- enough and be brave enough to complain will be the teacher.

  [`02-1672`,`511`,`FALSE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address, if I may, several concerns that have been raised during the -- the preceding arguments. One is to clarify some things about the scope of the administrative remedy. The other side, with respect, wants you to think that without the implied right of action for damages and fees, whistle blowers are left out in the cold. That is not true. The administrative remedy -- it's not just about funding termination. 34 C.F.R. 106.3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deems necessary. The OCR, as we say in our brief, has itself touted its flexible approach to enforcement which includes, among other things, as this Court noted in Gebser, citing back to its earlier -- pardon me -- decision in North Haven, individualized relief in appropriate circumstances. So the point, as Senator Bayh himself noted on the floor of the Senate, is that it is the threat of -- of funding termination. So while the OCR is wielding the club of funding termination, they can extract or leverage individualized relief in appropriate cases.`],

  [`02-1672`,`515`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well -- well, I will, I assume, perhaps foolishly, defer to the Solicitor General's office to tell you what -- what the DOJ has and hasn't done. What I can tell you is that -- that the DOJ manual that the other side cites throughout its briefs expressly encourages agencies, when enforcing these -- these things, to leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual claimants. So I can tell you that, as a matter of policy, this is far from a dead letter.`],
  [`02-1672`,`516`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`RESPONDENT`,`You -- you don't concede the point that it is the role of this Court to determine whether agencies are inefficient or not --`],

  [`02-1672`,`518`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`RESPONDENT`,`-- and if they are inefficient to -- to raise up private attorneys general to -- to fill the void?`],
  [`02-1672`,`519`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Of course not, Justice Scalia, and -- and the Court knows very well from my brief that our position is that when you're talking about implied rights of action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leading up to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sorts of policy considerations really are not relevant.`],
  [`02-1672`,`520`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`All right. If they're not relevant, do you think that the regulation which provides -- do you think it's unlawful?`],
  [`02-1672`,`521`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`We do not contest the validity of the regulation.`],
  [`02-1672`,`522`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Okay. If you don't contest the validity of it and you think it's lawful, do you think it's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?`],
  [`02-1672`,`523`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Absolutely, Your Honor.`],
  [`02-1672`,`524`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE BREYER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`What -- what is it doing?`],
  [`02-1672`,`525`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`It -- section 100.7(e), the regulation upon which Jackson chiefly relies, we readily concede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all -- all it does by its text -- and its structure makes clear all it does -- is to govern the internal processes of official OCR investigations. It does not go further than that. This Court in Sandoval was very clear that it was -- that it was only authoritative interpretations of a statute's terms that can be enforced pursuant to that statute's implied right of action. Another point I want to make about the administrative remedy. Justice Ginsburg asked whether funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been withdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in administrative enforcement. Another point about administrative enforcement is whether or not there are sufficient resources. That, obviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably the inordinate number of complaints about core, traditional discrimination. But as the other side has made clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the petitioner's brief -- and then there's a brief filed on behalf of the Southern Poverty Law Center that spins this out in some detail -- there just aren't many of these retaliation claims out there, either in the -- either -- either in the judicial system or at OCR.`],
  [`02-1672`,`526`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Why is that, do you think?`],
  [`02-1672`,`527`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, my -- I'm sorry.`],
  [`02-1672`,`528`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Is it because no remedy is available, or is it because there are just very few instances giving rise to such?`],
  [`02-1672`,`529`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, I think in all likelihood, it is the latter. Certainly I would think that the Court would presume -- would not presume ill of local school districts and -- and even State universities, but would presume that they are complying with, if not clearly articulated law, certainly good public policy. The second point is that what the -- the absence of private actions for retaliation shows is that title IX's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without the implied right of action.`],
  [`02-1672`,`530`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Do we decide this case on the assumption that there was retaliation here by virtue of a complaint of violation of title IX?`],
  [`02-1672`,`531`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Certainly, Your Honor --`],
  [`02-1672`,`532`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE O'CONNOR`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`We should decide it on that assumption?`],
  [`02-1672`,`533`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`You have to take as true, of course, the facts as pledged in the -- as pleaded in the complaint. Another point I'd like to make briefly is about the comparison to title VII. The other side wants you to look very closely at title VII when you're -- whether it's on the basis of sex or on the basis of such individual's sex, but they want you to ignore title VII and the fact that it very clearly and expressly deals with retaliation in a separate subsection, a separate provision. And I didn't -- I'll have to confess I didn't hear much during the first argument. I had my head in my own book, but what I did hear is Justice Souter referring to the -- the -- an instance in which Congress has a choice of two models for -- for constructing a statute, and it chooses one over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to allow Congress to make that choice. That's what happened here.`],
  [`02-1672`,`534`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Like the choice it made in 1982, very spare statute. When Congress got to title IX, it knew about Sullivan and so it -- this -- this statute in its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking resemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983. So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation that came in '64 and '65.`],
  [`02-1672`,`535`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, if -- if I could answer in two parts. First, to say that I think what was going on in 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have Congress in title VII addressing itself both to discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI, passed as part of the same piece of legislation, addressing itself solely to discrimination. And to use Justice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title VI model and not the title VII model. Now, to get to your question specifically, I think, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question, Sullivan -- I think there are a number of problems with the other side's reliance on Sullivan. First, with all due respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty opaque. It certainly does not announce with flashing lights a principle that every anti-discrimination provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary --`],
  [`02-1672`,`536`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`It says if you're thrown out of the club because you champion the rights of a black man, you have a right to sue under this statute.`],
  [`02-1672`,`537`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Even if I were to grant your assumption of clarity in Sullivan, which Justice Harlan, I presume, would not agree with -- he was left sort of scratching his head trying to figure out what the Court was trying to do. But even granting your assumption, if 1982 can be construed that way, that -- that construction does not necessarily carry over to every anti-discrimination provision. 1982, of course, uses different language to begin with and, more importantly, is -- is passed under Congress's power under the Thirteenth Amendment, which is the broadest conceivable --`],
  [`02-1672`,`538`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE STEVENS`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Yes, but it did construe the word discrimination, didn't it?`],
  [`02-1672`,`539`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`No, sir. Discrimination is not even in -- is not even in title -- rather, in 1982. So the language is very different --`],
  [`02-1672`,`540`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`On account of race is in it. Right?`],
  [`02-1672`,`541`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`I'll have to confess I don't -- it does say something like every person shall have the same right as -- dot, dot, dot, as white persons. But so the -- the language frankly is pretty different, and the more fundamental point I'm trying to make is that even if that's true for -- for that statute passed under that constitutional power, here we are talking, as Justice Kennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument about a Spending Clause statute, where it is required that conditions on the acceptance of Federal funds be express, and it is not clear to me where the Birmingham Board would have gotten its clear notice in this case. If you can imagine --`],
  [`02-1672`,`542`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`It seems to me they would get it when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare, and agency, you get up guidelines, that any responsible school board would say, well, we've got only one sentence in the statute. We better look at the regulations to find out what's required.`],
  [`02-1672`,`543`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`I agree, and -- and if -- and if the Birmingham Board, which I trust it did, looked to the regulation here, what it would have found is a regulation not that clarifies the substantive scope of title IX, but instead that -- that manages the internal operating procedures for official agency investigations. So to be sure, the Birmingham Board was on notice that it could not retaliate in -- in the business of an official OCR investigation, and if it did, it would be subject to administrative enforcement, but it was -- it was not on notice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-retaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it violated any such nonexistent --`],
  [`02-1672`,`544`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`But it's -- we're not talking about the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves. What must you do to comply? And it has in there you don't retaliate. So you mean that a board could responsibly take the position, well, the -- the regulations tell us we don't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agency breathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in front of us, then we can retaliate? I mean, they must have known the statute meant don't retaliate.`],
  [`02-1672`,`545`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`And -- and with respect, I think there is a difference, particularly given the clear notice requirements that this Court has -- has used in Spending Clause cases between retaliation in the context of an OCR investigation and retaliation generally, but -- I'm sorry.`],
  [`02-1672`,`546`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`I -- I really don't get that. If the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate, that's one of the things we're going -- that's going to be on our checklist. But the substantive rule is don't retaliate.`],
  [`02-1672`,`547`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Justice Stevens, may I respond?`],

  [`02-1672`,`549`,`TRUE`,`MR. NEWSOM`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Even granting your assumption, Justice Ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the -- is that the Birmingham Board would be subject to -- to a private right of action for damages and fees even in -- in the event that there were some generally applicable anti-retaliation provision.`],

  [`02-1672`,`557`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`Other statutes don't view the one as -- as being incorporated in the other.`],
  [`02-1672`,`558`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`The practice of Congress has not been consistent on incorporating express provisions sometimes because of language differences, but there are half a dozen major statutes that the courts of appeal have consistently assumed included retaliation as part of discrimination. Section 1981, section 1982, title VI, 1982 as determined by this Court, parts of the Rehabilitation Act have all been construed that way. And why would they not? The notion that you have to admit Geraldine Cannon to the University of Chicago Medical School, you can't discriminate against her on the basis of sex, but then you could turn around and expel her for complaining about your admissions policy makes no sense. In this case, relying upon the vagaries of what any administration might do about enforcement is not necessarily what Congress wanted, and that was this Court's decision in Cannon. And it's reaffirmed it frankly --`],
  [`02-1672`,`559`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`PETITIONER`,`There are no vagaries in private enforcement. Private attorneys general always act in the interest of the whole polity. There are no vagaries there.`],
  [`02-1672`,`560`,`TRUE`,`MR. DELLINGER`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Well, in this case, it has been known to effectuate anti-discrimination laws in order to bring them about by allowing people to step forward. The last point they make is that even if there's a cause of action, and even if the cause of action covers retaliation, it cannot be brought by Coach Jackson because he's not also the victim of the underlying discrimination. That makes no sense in law or in logic. If the captain of the boys' basketball team joins with the captain of the girls' basketball team in a supportive way to say, they're just not treating girls' basketball equally and fairly, and they're both suspended from their teams or dropped from the honor society in retaliation, it makes no sense. Either they both have -- they've both been discriminated against on the basis of sex because they're trying to rectify sex discrimination or neither is. And in this case, it's going to be critically important that this valuable statute, which has meant so much for athletic and academic opportunities for women, to have people like Coach Jackson able to be confident that they've got a right that they can enforce that will allow them to come forward within the school itself and try to rectify these anomalies in and under title IX.

  [`03-10198`,`573`,`TRUE`,`MR.

Of course, certain issues are waived. Trial issues are waived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other issues remain. And as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, especially in the guilty plea cases -- this Court well knows the effect of the Federal sentencing guidelines -- very complicated issues of sentencing law arise.

  [`03-10198`,`600`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE KENNEDY`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`Now, is that what you were going to say to Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's -- that it's far-reaching.`],
  [`03-10198`,`601`,`TRUE`,`MR. MORAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Yes.

So I don't agree that is is a -- simply a disparate impact case.

  [`03-10198`,`611`,`TRUE`,`MR. MORAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`It's not a -- a disparate impact claim I say, because it is intentionally aimed at the poor. The statute was designed to take away counsel from the poor and only from the poor.`],

We don't even have that here. All we have here is the indigent forced to shift for himself, forced to try and determine whether there are any issues, forced to order his own transcript.

  [`03-10198`,`643`,`TRUE`,`MR. MORAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`But, Your Honor, the problem is -- is that the statute requires only the poor, imposes a forced waiver on only the poor.`],

And so the Michigan constitution explicitly still provides a right to appeal, but it changes the method.

  [`03-10198`,`729`,`TRUE`,`MR. MORAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Yes. After Abela v. Martin in the Sixth Circuit. And there is a -- a whole host of Federal district court decisions in the Eastern and Western District of Michigan all saying that when an order is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented, the AEDPA standard of review applies. And so the State obtains tremendous benefits from this procedure. They obtain deference on habeas corpus review. They prevent the indigent, if the indigent were to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from beginning relitigation on State collateral review. And so the State very happily argues for all of those purposes that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come before this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a decision on the merits. It's really discretionary despite what it says because they are hoping that this Court will conclude that it is a discretionary appeal. In fact, the State --`],

  [`03-10198`,`731`,`TRUE`,`MR. MORAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`-- has made an even more radical argument in its brief. The State maintains that the appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal, and that is plainly contrary to the -- to the actual function of that court because there is a provision that if trial counsel suddenly realizes in a plea case, after sentencing, that there are issues that she should have raised, it allows her to do that. And so the State now argues that that's really the first-tier appeal, and then the application that follows after that to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal. I'll just point out that even the State's amicus doesn't agree with that, and -- and rightfully so in light of Swenson v. Bosler, which has rejected an attempt to reorganize by labeling how one's appeals go.`],
  [`03-10198`,`732`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE GINSBURG`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`Mr. Moran, before your -- your time is up, I did want to know what is your position on -- let's say that there is -- you prevail and there is a right to counsel for these applications to appeal. And if counsel looks at the case and determines that there is no tenable ground for an appeal, could counsel file the equivalent of an Anders brief?`],
  [`03-10198`,`733`,`TRUE`,`MR. MORAN`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`PETITIONER`,`Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in fact, I have done that personally. Before I became an academic, I worked at the State Appellate Defender Office in Detroit and was appointed to represent indigents on plea appeals. And in a significant percentage of the cases -- I can't quote you the numbers off the top of my head -- after reviewing the case, the appellate counsel then concludes that there is no merit, that there are no grounds to proceed, that the defendant in fact got whatever it was she bargained for in the plea bargaining, at which point then either a motion to withdraw may be filed or -- or the equivalent, the Michigan equivalent, of an Anders brief. And so that is done in a number of cases. It is our position that that procedure actually helps improve the appellate process in Michigan because without that process, all you have are indigents like Mr. Halbert, a special education student with mental disabilities, trying to identify his own issues and fall -- and filing, in -- in his case, with the help of a fellow prisoner because he could not have done it himself -- the help of a fellow prisoner, an application that is completely incoherent, misses several issues that are right on the face of the record, correctly asserts that his sentencing guidelines were misscored but -- but without explaining why, without even identifying which sentencing guidelines were misscored. And in fact, he received a minimum sentence that was approximately three times too high under the sentencing guidelines. The State concedes that one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in the State's favor erroneously. We concede one of the -- one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in Mr. Halbert's favor erroneously. But then there were two others, and the most important ones, the OV, Offense Variable, 13. That was scored for 25 points in both cases. And so Mr. -- Mr. Halbert, in fact, received a sentence that was much too high. Michigan requires -- Michigan is one of the few States that requires that ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on direct appeal or they're lost. And so at that point, Mr. Halbert had to figure out a way to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing, which requires an evidentiary hearing at which trial counsel must be called, assuming trial counsel is still available to be called, all from prison, and there was no possible way he could do that. So it's not very surprising that even with the help of a fellow inmate, that his application for leave to appeal was completely incoherent. The fellow inmate actually did write the -- the trial judge and say we need to have an evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel. But under the statute, the judge had no discretion to grant that motion. Under the statute, only if there was already an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines, only then would the judge be required to appoint counsel, and of course, the guidelines, as misscored without objection from defense counsel -- there was no upward departure at that point. If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.`],
  [`03-10198`,`734`,`TRUE`,`CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`PETITIONER`,`Very well, Mr. Moran. Mr. Restuccia.`],
  [`03-10198`,`736`,`FALSE`,`MR. RESTUCCIA`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to start with the factual claim regarding the waiver that the Court identified, pages 22 and 23 from the joint appendix, being the point at which Mr. Halbert, in fact, waived his right to the appointment of appellate counsel. I think Justice Scalia is right in noting that he was told specifically it's under these conditions you'll be appointed a counsel; under these conditions, you might be appointed counsel. From context it's unambiguous that he would otherwise not receive counsel. And what's important is at the joint appendix on page 45, the trial court, in fact, made a factual finding on this point. So in order for this Court to conclude that Mr. Halbert did not waive his right to appellate counsel under the particular circumstances, you would have -- you would have to conclude that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its factual finding.`],
  [`03-10198`,`737`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SOUTER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, I mean, wouldn't we have to conclude that if we're going to apply the same standards here that we usually do in -- in the plea waiver situation? I mean, we -- the -- the classic point of it all is the knowing -- the -- the intelligent, voluntary waiver of a known right. And leaving aside the equal protection problem here, even if we didn't have that, I don't see that there would be -- have been an adequate waiver here because he was never told that he had the right that he now claims as a matter of due process. You indeed, dispute it.`],

  [`03-10198`,`741`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SOUTER`,`JUSTICE`,`PETITIONER`,`RESPONDENT`,`Well, the -- the appeal of his right -- the appeal as of right point, as I understand it, is a different point. What they're getting at there is it will be discretionary with the reviewing court whether your case is reviewed on the merits on some point if you ask for it. We're here dealing with the right to counsel, and it seems to me unless he were told that he had the right to counsel that he claims and he then waived it, that there wouldn't be a -- an -- an adequate waiver under Boykin.`],
  [`03-10198`,`742`,`TRUE`,`MR.

There must be -- it's so obvious that there must be an obvious answer, but I haven't heard the answer. He knows Michigan law or his lawyer does. The Michigan lawyer looks at the statute. It says a defendant who pleads guilty shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review with some exceptions, which they claim are inadequate. So he thinks the law is shall not. I have no right. So he doesn't not only -- not only is he not waiving a known right, there's nothing for him to waive. He has no such right. Now, obviously, when there's nothing for him to waive, how could he waive anything?

It said only when -- if this exists, I must, and if that exists, I must, but did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal.

  [`03-10198`,`762`,`TRUE`,`JUSTICE SCALIA`,`JUSTICE`,`RESPONDENT`,`RESPONDENT`,`Of course, your case is a little stronger than -- than the court just asked -- just saying I must appoint counsel in this circumstance and I must appoint counsel in another circumstance. That might have left open the implication that you could appoint counsel in other circumstances, but the court went on and to say I might appoint counsel in this circumstance and I might appoint counsel in the other circumstance. So if there's any implication from it, the implication is not just that I have -- I have listed all the areas in which I must, but it's also I have listed all the areas in which I either must or even may, if there's an implication.`],

  [`03-10198`,`765`,`TRUE`,`MR. RESTUCCIA`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`That's right. And they -- they did -- they did modify the form. So on the question of the underlying constitutionality, I want to -- I want to make a few points, that the -- the threshold question really is whether there's an appeal as of right in Michigan for a plea-based conviction. Michigan law is clear that there is no appeal by right. It's an application process and it's a discretionary review. The Michigan Court of Appeals has no obligation to correct errors in these cases, has no obligation to review the merits.`],

  [`03-10198`,`767`,`TRUE`,`MR. RESTUCCIA`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`No. The law in the Sixth Circuit is in fact in conflict with a case -- an earlier case, McKenzie v.

  [`03-10198`,`781`,`TRUE`,`MR. RESTUCCIA`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`That's right. That's right. And because there is no appeal as of right under Michigan law, this -- the Douglas case doesn't govern the disposition. Ultimately the -- the controlling is Ross. And the issue then is whether Michigan provides a meaningful access to an indigent defendant who wants to bring an application for leave. That's really the -- I think the heart of the constitutional issue. There are three distinct characteristics of the Michigan system. The -- the nature of the review is discretionary, and I think comparable to the kind of review in Ross that was described by this Court for the North Carolina Supreme Court. Mr. Moran makes a claim that the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. With regard to applications for leave where there is no right to have the merits reviewed, it is not an error-correcting court.

I think that's right. That's one understanding of the -- of the order that's consistent with the way it's been treated by the court of appeals and also, most importantly, by the Michigan constitution, when the people of the State of Michigan said trial-based convictions, there's an appeal as of right.

  [`03-10198`,`806`,`TRUE`,`MR. RESTUCCIA`,`NOT JUSTICE`,`NA`,`RESPONDENT`,`Yes. The court of appeals in the Bobenal case said, in fact, examining virtually the identical language of the issue raised here, that this was not a decision on the merits and that it was not itself bound as law of the case because the merits had not been resolved. I think the Bulger case is kind of the paramount case because it is the Michigan Supreme Court conferring the proper legal understanding of the applications for leave, and it said that the nature of the leave is discretionary. I think that fits with common sense understanding because there is no right to have the merits reviewed. Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to say the application were discretionary if a defendant would have a claim to have any error corrected. Otherwise, he would have a claim on the court of appeals.
